WHY FOCUS ON THE LEARNER?
I
nterest and enrollment in online courses continues to grow. We are no longer
in the first wave of online course development. The percentage of undergraduates who took Internet-based distance education courses in 1999–2000
increased to 57 percent (National Center for Education Statistics, 2002). Along
with the surge in online learning has come a realization by many faculty that they
need to focus on techniques to increase participation and collaborative learning.
We have moved beyond the “early adopter” stage. Faculty are now looking for
concrete methods to make their courses work. They now know that a course cannot simply be created with the expectation that students will know how to access it, navigate it, and participate to the levels they expect. In other words, they
realize that attention needs to be paid to orienting students to learning online in
every course they take.

When online learning was in its infancy, the focus in the field was to orient
faculty to the use of technology and how to develop an online course. With the
realization, however, that in an online course students will not simply know how
to engage with the instructor, the material, or one another, the emerging focus is
on the student. Online learning, in its best form, is learner-centered and learnerfocused. But what does it really mean to be learner-focused in the online environment?
In our own work of training faculty to teach effectively online, we have come
to realize that although we talk about the learner as the focus of the process, we
xiii

too have focused on the instructor. The learner has somehow been left out of
the equation.
Why is that? Certainly, all of our courses are developed with the learner in
mind, aren’t they? Our response is: Not really. We recently conducted an online
faculty development course. The group was composed of a mix of new and somewhat seasoned faculty who were making the transition to the online environment.
Some had taught a few courses; some had taught none. One member of the group
announced that he felt that lecturing was still the best way to reach learners. Consequently, what he intended to do was to videotape himself delivering all of his
lectures and then use streaming video to present the lectures to his online students.
Another member of the group supported that decision, whereas another expressed
horror that an instructor would even think of doing this. The instructor had given
no thought to bandwidth issues, let alone the boredom factor of watching an instructor deliver a lecture online. Whose needs were being met here? Was this
course being developed with the learner in mind? We think not.
Pedagogy, Andragogy, or Heutagogy?
“Higher education has given priority to the integration of technology into the curriculum. As this has occurred, institutions are faced with the many issues that surround making the lessons succeed technologically. . . . It is, therefore, easy for the
instructional design of such curricula to be put on the side while we get technology
issues ‘under control.’ Faculty need to focus on learning theory in the design of instructional technology so that they can create lessons that are not only technologyeffective but that are meaningful from the learner’s standpoint” (Fidishun, n.d.).
Although some faculty may disagree, using the principles of adult learning theory may help move us closer to meeting the needs of the virtual student.
As noted by the National Center for Education Statistics (2002), online learners span an age range from late adolescence to late adulthood. Approaching those
learners from the standpoint of how adults learn, also known as andragogy (Knowles,
1992), can help bridge the gap between faculty- and learner-centered models of
course delivery. We have often been asked why we have referred to our work as
electronic pedagogy rather than andragogy when what we have been promoting is
learner-centered, adult-focused learning. We have avoided becoming enmeshed
in this debate by responding simply that what we are promoting is the use of
best practices in the online classroom. However, because we have focused on the
training of instructors where it is the “teacher who decide[s] what the learner
need[s] to know, and indeed, how the knowledge and skills should be taught” (Hase
and Kenyon, 2000) we believed that we fell into the pedagogy category.
xiv Preface
As we have looked at this debate anew, however, we have come to realize that
what we are promoting as we focus more on the learner and a learner-centered
educational process is neither pedagogy nor andragogy, but instead heutagogy, or
self-directed learning (Hase and Kenyon, 2000). In fact, no matter what terminology is used to describe what should be occurring in the online classroom, the
reality is that good online learning involves all three theoretical constructs. The
instructor provides the container, pedagogically speaking, through which students
can explore the territory of the course and, it is hoped, apply their learning to
their lives. In this book, we focus on how to make all that happen by looking at the
virtual student, who that person is and what that person needs to succeed in an
online course, what the virtual student should expect, and what the instructor
should expect from the virtual student. We also provide a range of tips and tricks
for fostering the success of the student online.
The focus of the book is primarily “cohort-based” learning, that is, students
who begin and end a course together during a quarter, semester, or a seminar
scheduled at the convenience of the instructor and students. We have found that
the community building tips we use and discuss are difficult to implement in noncohort situations, such as continuing education courses where students start and
end at varying times. This does not mean that some attempts at interactive community building in such courses will not be successful, but it is simply more difficult to implement. We have also found the needs of students enrolled in continuing
education courses to be different—often these students are looking for the quickest, easiest way to complete requirements for licensure and the like and are not
seeking the level of interactivity that an undergraduate or graduate student or
even a corporate employee would seek. Consequently, those working with continuing education students may find some of the material contained in this book
helpful, but some material simply may not apply in this situation.
Becoming Truly Learner-Focused
A learner-focused, self-directed approach is based on a core belief that we cannot
teach but can only facilitate the acquisition of knowledge. In our previous writing,
we noted that several key characteristics enable an instructor to be successful in
the online classroom:
• Flexibility
• A willingness to learn from one’s students and others
• A willingness to give up control to the learners in both course design and the
learning process
• A willingness to collaborate
Preface xv
• A willingness to move away from the traditional faculty role (Palloff and Pratt,
2002)
How actually to do this is the focus of this book. These characteristics form
the core of what we consider to be advanced facilitation skills for online instructors as well as the keys to building community and interactivity online and becoming truly learner-focused.
Audience for the Book
The audience for this book is not only faculty engaged in online teaching and
learning but also those involved with developing and designing courses, because
the principles and techniques we discuss apply to instructional design with the online student in mind. In addition, those involved in the development and marketing of online programs will benefit from reading this book. In our experience,
recruitment and retention of the online student is an ongoing issue in many academic institutions. If recruiters pay attention to who the online student is and what
that student needs in order to be successful, recruitment should become an easier
task and retention should increase. Finally, those involved in doing e-training in
the corporate sector will also benefit from reading this book. Corporate trainers
who are moving their training programs online are encountering the same concerns about the online student as instructors in academic institutions. The issue is
not whether courses are being offered for credit in an academic setting but rather
who is attracted to online learning and who should and should not be there. This
book should help corporate trainers make better decisions about which training
programs to move to the online environment and how to make those programs
truly learner-focused.
Online Learning Across Disciplines
Often as we present to faculty on how to deliver effective online learning, we hear
from those who claim that the interactive, community-based approach that we
promote cannot be used effectively across disciplines. Janet Donald (2002), in her
book Learning to Think: Disciplinary Perspectives, notes that some basic questions guide
the exploration of content in any discipline: “First, what kind of learning environment does the discipline provide? Second, according to the discipline, what
knowledge and higher-order thinking processes are important for students to learn?
Third, what are the optimal ways of cultivating these thinking processes? Enxvi Preface
compassing all of the disciplines, a final question is, How can post-secondary institutions promote students’ intellectual development in all disciplines?” (p. xi). If
we use these questions as a guide, we believe that the principles we promote for
online education can cross disciplines. Certainly, there are disciplinary differences
in delivery of material and the skills that need to be acquired, but we have seen
good use of interactivity and community building in courses such as accounting,
astronomy, chemistry, and mathematics, just as we have in sociology, psychology,
and organizational behavior.
The issue relates in part to how we see ourselves as faculty in the delivery of
knowledge and information. Donald states, “Faculty of necessity must play an important role in formulating an explanation of the context and process of scholarly
inquiry, how it governs their lives, and how students have the opportunity to engage in this process. . . . But our students tell us that without our taking responsibility to build a scholarly community, they will flounder” (p. 292). The need
to be learner-focused transcends disciplines. The need to engage in community
building does as well.
We primarily teach in the social and behavioral sciences and in business and
computer science. We have worked with many faculty from many disciplines who
are successfully teaching online. Although many of the examples in this book come
from our own experience in teaching online, we believe that the basic principles
we promote are applicable to most disciplines in some fashion.
The Corporate Student
Trainers working in the corporate setting should find much of the material contained in this book applicable to their work. More often, we are hearing that business organizations are seeking more interactivity in their online training programs.
Previously, online training in the corporate sector was delivered in what is termed
web-based or computer-based fashion, that is, the participant interacts only with
a course on the computer but not with other participants or possibly even an
instructor. As business organizations increasingly look to becoming “learning organizations,” wherein education and learning are becoming a more valued commodity as is the management of knowledge, interactivity in online training is
achieving higher status. In fact, we have been called on to deliver training to trainers in corporate settings regarding increased interactivity online and in building
community within the organization.
In our experience, however, we have found that the motivation to engage in
online training differs for the corporate student. Because he or she is not working
toward a letter grade or degree credit, other motivators are necessary, such as credit
Preface xvii
toward promotion, pay, or other benefits. However, the issues we discuss in this
book, such as time management, learning styles, and the need for a good orientation to online learning certainly apply regardless of the setting in which the
course is being delivered.
Organization of Contents
This book is organized in two parts that are followed by two resource sections. The
first part of the book profiles the virtual student. Chapter One answers the question “Who is the virtual student?” by providing a look at the demographics of online students, a predictor of success factors for online learning, and an analysis
of what we view to be the social psychology of the online student. Chapter Two
goes back to our original work on the importance of participation in a learning
community and looks specifically at the student’s role in that community. We analyze student-instructor and student-student interaction in the learning community and discuss how to maximize that interaction. We also look at how to express
and deliver the content of a course without sacrificing interaction, and we review
the important subject of collaboration. Chapter Three deals with the somewhat
controversial issue of learning styles and how they apply to online learning, and
makes suggestions for ways in which instructors can address all learning styles online without a technology-heavy approach. Chapter Four deals with a variety of
issues—geography, multiculturalism, religion, literacy, and gender—and how they
affect a student’s online learning. Finally, what makes a good student services program for those working online? What kind of support does the online student need
from the institution? These are the questions we answer in Chapter Five.
Part Two provides a guide to working with the virtual student. It covers a number of specific issues, concerns, and strategies for doing so. Chapter Six builds on
the first section by analyzing the elements of a good student orientation to online
learning. What should be included and how should it be delivered? Chapter Seven
looks at time and commitment issues, specifically focusing on the development of
time management skills. Chapter Eight looks at another controversial issue—assessment and evaluation—and includes a discussion about plagiarism and cheating. Chapter Nine deals with the important issues of copyright and intellectual
property as well as other legal issues and concerns. This chapter is not intended
to provide the final word on these important topics but rather to provide an
overview and guide to their application to the online student. Chapters Ten and
Eleven close Part Two of the book. Chapter Ten focuses on attrition and retention,
issues that are important to administrators and faculty alike. This chapter also looks
at an issue that never fails to surface in discussion with faculty: group size and its
impact on online teaching and learning. The chapter emphasizes quality, whether
xviii Preface
in an online course or an online degree program, as the critical issue in the recruitment and retention of the virtual student. Chapter Eleven pulls together the
best practices in online teaching—practices which are truly learner-focused.
We close the book with the Toolkit for a Successful Online Student, which
brings together all of the tips, tricks, strategies, and suggestions provided throughout the book. Resource A contains faculty tools and Resource B contains student
tools. As we have traveled and worked with faculty across the United States, we
have been asked for samples of guidelines for courses or a sample frequently asked
questions file to orient students to a course. We created this toolkit in response to
these requests. It is meant to sum up the book as well as be a stand-alone piece
that faculty, trainers, and instructional designers can use when creating and delivering an online course.
As in our previous books, we feel that our words alone are not enough to convey what we are attempting to say. Consequently, we look to the words of our students and their ongoing contribution to our learning process. As in the past, their
unedited quotes from online courses are included in the book to illustrate and explain various concepts. This book was written through their words, experiences,
and eyes.
When instructors and students are able to reap the benefits of a well-designed
online course, the result is excitement about what is possible in the online realm
and about learning in general. The virtual student, after participating in such a
course, is often able to reflect on the difference in the quality of relationships
formed with the instructor, other students, and the process of collaborative knowledge creation that results. The changing relationship between faculty and their
students and faculty and their area of content expertise through interaction with
their students online also helps to expand the network through which faculty can
learn. Faculty, then, are also virtual students, and this book is for us all.
